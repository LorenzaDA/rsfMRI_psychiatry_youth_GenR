Scripts for the project *Exploring the longitudinal associations of functional network connectivity and psychiatric symptom changes in youth*.
The study information is available in preprint format at https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.26.22282787 . 
This project involved analyses within the Generation R study, 
for the longitudinal relationships of resting-state functional network connectivity with psychiatric symptoms
in youth from the general population.
We leveraged two repeated assessments (ages 10 and 14 years on average).
We ran analyses for static FNC (summarized in graph theory metrics) and dynamic FNC (5 states and transitions across states). 
Scripts are numbered.
